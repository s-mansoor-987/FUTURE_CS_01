In this hands-on cybersecurity internship project, you’ll perform vulnerability assessment of a real-world or open-source web application. The goal is to identify security flaws using ethical hacking tools and OWASP standards. This type of project simulates real client work, especially for startups, SaaS companies, or e-commerce platforms that need to secure their websites.

You’ll learn how hackers target websites—and how to defend them. Your findings will be compiled into a professional security report, which can be added to your portfolio.
Set up and explore a test web app (like DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop)
Use scanning tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto
Test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF
Map the vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 threats
Document findings with screenshots, impact level, and remediation steps
Compile a Security Assessment Report (PDF format)
🎯 Skills You’ll Gain
🔓 Web application vulnerability scanning
📄 Security documentation and reporting
⚔️ Knowledge of OWASP Top 10 threats
🧠 Basic ethical hacking and penetration testing
🔍 Threat modeling and risk analysis

🛠️ Tools You’ll Use

OWASP Juice Shop – Intentionally vulnerable app for learning
DVWA – Damn Vulnerable Web Application for practicing attacks
OWASP ZAP – Open-source vulnerability scanner
Burp Suite (Community Edition) – Web app testing toolkit
Kali Linux (optional) – Security testing OS with built-in tools
Google Docs or Word – For your final report
